## Title

Spotify Integration

## Introduction

This proposal suggests integrating Spotify with the Catoff-Reclaim project. The integration aims to enhance user experience by allowing them to authenticate their Spotify activity, participate in music-related challenges, and share their music preferences within the Catoff platform. By connecting to Spotify's API, users can showcase their favorite tracks, playlists, and listening habits, fostering a vibrant music community on Catoff.

## External APIs Needed

- Spotify API: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api

## Use Cases

1. **User authentication**: Verify a user's Spotify account by accessing their listening history, playlists, and favorite artists.
2. **Music analysis**: Analyze a user's listening habits, including top tracks, genres, and listening patterns over time.
3. **Playlist synchronization**: Sync a user's Spotify playlists with Catoff, allowing them to participate in playlist challenges and share music recommendations.
4. **Collaborative playlists**: Enable users to create and collaborate on playlists within the Catoff platform, leveraging Spotify's extensive music catalog.

## Data Provider

- **Name**: Spotify
- **Hash Value**: [Is this hexadecimal value random, or does it need to be obtained from somewhere?]

## Code Snippet

Below is a code snippet that demonstrates the key parts of the Spotify integration. The full implementation should follow this service file template.

**`services/SpotifyService.js`**

```javascript
const { ReclaimServiceResponse } = require('../utils/reclaimServiceResponse');
const axios = require('axios');

exports.processSpotifyData = async (proof, providerName) => {
  const spotifyUserId = JSON.parse(proof[0].claimData.context).extractedParameters.userId;
  const lastUpdateTimeStamp = proof[0].claimData.timestamp;

  const userData = await getUserData(spotifyUserId);

  return new ReclaimServiceResponse(providerName, lastUpdateTimeStamp, spotifyUserId, userData, proof[0]);
};

const getUserData = async (userId) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/${userId}`);
    const userData = response.data;

    console.log(`User data for Spotify user ${userId}:`, userData);
    return userData;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error fetching Spotify user data for ${userId}:`, error);
    return null;
  }
};
```
